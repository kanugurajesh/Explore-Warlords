                    Attila the Hun was a brutal leader known for his destructive tactics. He massacred the entire
                    population of the city of Aquileia and led devastating campaigns against the Eastern Roman Empire.
                    However, much of the historical record of Attila's life and deeds comes from accounts written by his
                    enemies, so some stories about his brutality may be biased or exaggerated.</p>

                    Genghis Khan was a brutal conqueror who used terror and violence to subdue his enemies. He was known
                    for his merciless tactics, such as massacring entire populations and using human shields. Under his
                    leadership, the Mongol Empire became the largest contiguous empire in history, but at a great cost
                    in human life and suffering.</p>

                    As a military commander and later as a dictator, Julius Caesar was known for his brutality towards
                    his enemies and political opponents. He famously ordered the execution of thousands of Gauls after
                    conquering their lands, and is said to have personally participated in battles and massacres. He
                    also used violence and intimidation to maintain his grip on power, famously crossing the Rubicon
                    River with his army and declaring war on the Roman Senate.</p>

                    Caligula was known for his extreme cruelty and sadism, with many historians describing him as a
                    madman. He ordered the execution of his own family members, engaged in incestuous relationships, and
                    was said to have made his horse a consul. He also staged violent spectacles, such as having
                    prisoners torn apart by wild animals, and would often torture and kill people on a whim.</p>
